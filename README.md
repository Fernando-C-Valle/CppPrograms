# Polynomial Derivative
This is a simple program where the user can enter a degree of a polynomial and 
then get the derivative, represented using the format f'(x). 

The elements of the polynomial must match the degree given in the first input.
Example: 
Degree: 4
f(x)=3x^4 + 2x^3 + 6x^2 + 8x + 4

f'(x)=12x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8 + 0

## Execution
To run this program just type this command:
g++ -Wall -o executableName polynomialDerivatives.cpp
